Idea
It is obvious that smartphones comparing with old cell phones give as much more possibilities. However it all costs. Battery in my first mobilephone was able to last one week. Now I have to charge battery every single day.
A lot of things has impact on battery life time: bigger than in old cellphones screen, camera, wifi, bluetooth and so on.
We can't do a lot with screen, but we can save some battery power by turning off WiFi. 
This application should turn off WiFi while we are no longer using browser, and turn on WiFi while we open browser.

Why?
My mom (also has a smartphone) doesn't know how to turning on and off WiFi.
I'm lazy enaugh to make an app that will do something for me.

About:
-turning off WiFi when browser is closed (it should turn off not immediatly but after some short time)
-turning on Wifi when we open browser
-configure time that app waits for turning off WiFi
later: configurable list of apps that should turn on/off WiFi

What do we need?
-service that will be work in background and waiting for actions with browser(apps)
	*we should be able to turn on and off this service
